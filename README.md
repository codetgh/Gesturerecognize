# GestureRecognition

User can draw shapes like circle, triangle, rectangle, heart, hexagonal etc shapes on available space which recognize by the gesture 
library and provide name on textView and match percentage on console.

First, you have to create a gesture file which contains all shapes with their name. You can download a gesture library from play store
and build whatever you want to recognize(here shape). 

Second, add created file to your app section raw folder and you can use above code.

Note:- I have added shape and alphabetical gesture file in my project. 

Let me know, if you have query or suggestions.

Thanks.
